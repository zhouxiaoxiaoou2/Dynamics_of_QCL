## Multi-mode QCL Feedback Simulation

This repository contains MATLAB code for simulating multi-mode Quantum Cascade Lasers (QCLs) under optical feedback.
The simulation solves the coupled rate equations using dde23 and generates output figures and spectra.

## Features
- Multi-mode photon number dynamics

- Carrier population evolution (N3 and N2 levels)

- Output power vs. time traces

- Optical spectrum and RF spectrum calculation

- Mode power distribution
